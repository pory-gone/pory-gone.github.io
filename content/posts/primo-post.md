Welcome to my digital corner! This is the beginning of something glitchy and fun.

## Why this site?

I created this space to share my projects, thoughts, and experiments with the world. A place where code meets creativity and chaos.

## What to expect

On this site you'll find:

- **Blog**: Technical articles, reflections, and random thoughts
- **Portfolio**: My projects and creations
- **Chaos Zone**: Pure digital chaos - experiments, glitch art, and things that shouldn't exist

## The aesthetic

If you're wondering about the glitchy pink and cyan theme - it's inspired by Porygon, the digital Pokémon. A tribute to the beautiful chaos of the digital world.

Stay tuned for new content!
