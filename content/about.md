# 👾 Who I Am

Hey! I'm **Porygone** and this is my digital corner where code, creativity, and a bit of healthy chaos coexist.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This site is divided into three distinct zones:

### 📝 Blog
Thoughts, reflections, and articles about whatever crosses my mind. A mix between formal and informal, between technical and personal.

### 💼 Portfolio
My projects, experiments, and creations. Things that work (more or less) and that I'm proud of.

### ⚡ Chaos Zone
Pure. Digital. Chaos.

Wild experiments, nonsensical code, glitch art, and everything that doesn't fit anywhere else. The no-rules zone where anything can happen.

## 🎨 The Style

If you're wondering why this site has a glitchy aesthetic with pink and cyan colors... well, it's inspired by **Porygon**, the digital Pokémon. A tribute to the organized chaos of the digital world.
